# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 12th March 2023

**Today's Progress**: Used the FCC tutorial to learn about Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** Given #100DaysOfCode FAQ on newer programmers I started with a FCC tutorial so I can build myself into working on projects with additional libraries. I find working on visual elements very rewarding, so starting with bootstrap was fun to learn about a styling library.
